As someone living with progressive Multiple Sclerosis, the ability to engage in hobbies that once brought me immense joy, like painting, has become increasingly challenging. My hands no longer cooperate as they once did, and the fine motor control required for traditional art or even navigating complex software interfaces can feel insurmountable.

This is where AI has become my unexpected co-pilot, a bridge to recovering lost capabilities. My focus isn't just on _making_ things, but on _reclaiming_ the process of creation itself.

## Connecting AI to 3D Printing with Cura

One area I'm incredibly excited about is 3D printing, specifically how AI can assist with designing and manipulating models within software like **Cura**. Traditionally, navigating Cura requires precise mouse movements and keyboard shortcuts â€“ a significant hurdle for me.

Here's how I'm starting to bridge that gap:

### 1. Voice-to-Text for Command Input

Using advanced text-to-voice software, I can now articulate commands that would be cumbersome to type or click through. For example, instead of manually selecting menus, I can say:

- "Open file menu"
- "Select model scale"
- "Set infill to twenty percent"

This direct interaction bypasses a huge physical barrier.

### 2. AI for Prompt-Based Model Generation

While I can't physically sculpt, AI generative models allow me to conceptualize and create 3D forms through natural language prompts. I'm exploring tools that translate descriptions like:

- "Generate a simple, abstract vase with flowing lines, suitable for FDM printing."
- "Create a low-polygon figure of a person sitting peacefully, designed for easy support removal."

These AI-generated models can then be imported into Cura for slicing.

### 3. Hotkeys and Custom Macros (My Next Frontier)

My next deep dive involves creating custom hotkeys and voice-activated macros specific to Cura. Imagine saying "slice now" and having a complex sequence of actions executed automatically. This reduces repetitive strain and makes the process far more fluid. I'll be sharing detailed guides on these as I build them out.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about printing objects; it's about empowerment. It's about finding new ways to express myself and engage with technology, even as my body changes. The "slop" on the internet might be pervasive, but the human story, the genuine struggle, and the innovative solutions borne from necessity, will always cut through the noise.

Stay tuned as I document more of these workflows, hotkeys, and AI-powered hacks. My hope is that these insights can also benefit others navigating similar challenges.
